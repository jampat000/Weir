"""Turn media-manager queue signals into Refiner domain rows that remember who said what.

:mod:`mediamop.modules.refiner.domain` decides *whether* a row blocks a file. It has no
idea which manager the row came from, and should not: it is the one layer that was
already vendor-neutral. So attribution is carried alongside the view here, which is what
lets a blocked-upstream reason say "Deluno (Main) is still importing this file" instead
of naming a product the operator may not even have installed.

Domain applicability is ``any(...)`` over rows, so asking it about one row at a time
gives the same verdict as asking about all of them — and tells us which row it was.
