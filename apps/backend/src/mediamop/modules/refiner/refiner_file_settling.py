"""Has this file finished being written, and can MediaMop actually touch it?

Refiner decided a file was finished by comparing its mtime against one global number.
That is a prediction — "writing usually takes less than N seconds" — and predictions fail
in both directions. Set it low and Refiner remuxes a half-written file. Set it high and
everything waits for a deadline that has nothing to do with the file. The case that
breaks it outright is a stalled download: mtime stops moving while the download is paused,
the threshold elapses, and the file looks finished precisely because nothing is happening
to it.

Watching the **size** asks the real question. Two observations of the same size, far
enough apart, is evidence that writing stopped. A resumed download changes the size and
starts the clock again on its own, with no special case for it.

The observations come from consecutive scans rather than from sleeping inside one. The
scan already runs on a cadence, the previous size is already a column, and a worker
blocked in ``sleep`` is a worker not doing anything else.
