"""Which managers look after a media scope, and asking all of them.

This replaces the single ``(url, key)`` tuple that Refiner used to resolve from a
hardcoded scope-to-product map. That map could only ever answer with one manager, so a
4K-plus-1080p pair of instances was invisible, and so was one manager running alongside
another during a migration.

A scope now resolves to **N connections** and the caller asks all of them. What to do
with a manager that could not answer is deliberately left to the caller, because the
right answer differs: a watched-folder scan degrades to the file-settling gates and
says so, while anything standing in front of a delete refuses to proceed.
