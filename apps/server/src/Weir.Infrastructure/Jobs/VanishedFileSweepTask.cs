/// </summary>
/// <remarks>
/// A library fed by a media manager's hand-offs often has its periodic scan off, so a rule that ran only inside a scan would
/// never clear its rows. This runs the same rule on its own clock. It never queues work, so it cannot pick up a stray file a scan
/// would have processed. A library whose watched folder cannot be read is skipped, so an unmounted share never empties the list.
