/// The libraries first-run setup can offer once a media manager or download client is connected: one per media type, with
/// the watched folder the connection already knows and a default output folder beside it. Composes what the library editor
/// already reads (<see cref="ManagerSetupCheck.SuggestFoldersAsync"/> for Sonarr, Radarr and Deluno,
/// <see cref="DownloadClientSuggestions"/> for bare download clients) and only ever reads: nothing is created, and nothing
/// on a manager or download client is changed.
/// </summary>
/// <remarks>
/// A folder is offered only when it is one library's own: never a download client's default completed folder, which every
/// media type saves to, and never one that overlaps a workflow already set up or another offer.
/// A new install starts with an empty Movies and an empty TV library, so an offer fills one of those in when its media
/// type still has one with no folders, and is a new library only when the first library of that type is already in use.
