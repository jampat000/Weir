/// <remarks>
/// <para>A bulk job (a watched-folder scan, the vanished-file sweep, retention, a library index update) writes in short
/// transactions so that no other writer waits long for any one of them. That alone is not enough. SQLite gives the lock to
/// whoever asks once it is free, and a connection that is already waiting sleeps between its tries, for up to 100 ms. A job
/// that begins its next transaction the moment its last one commits wins every time, and a hand-off or a progress update
/// ends up waiting for the whole job after all.</para>
/// <para>So after each transaction the job stands back for <see cref="PauseFactor"/> times as long as it held the lock, and
/// never less than <see cref="MinimumPause"/>. The lock is then free about three quarters of the time, so a waiting writer's
/// next try usually finds it free, and a long wait needs several unlucky tries in a row. The job takes longer, which a
/// background job can afford. No queue or shared lock is involved; the job only leaves gaps.</para>
