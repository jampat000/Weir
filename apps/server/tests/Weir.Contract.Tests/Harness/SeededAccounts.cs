/// PHC format as <c>users.password_hash</c> holds it: 1 lane, 32-byte hash, 16-byte salt). They are made at the smallest
/// cost the server's verifier accepts (time 1, memory 8 KiB), because the server reads the cost from the stored hash and a
/// seeded account would otherwise spend about a second of every sign-in on a cost nothing here is testing. The cost the
/// product itself uses is what bootstrap, password change and recovery produce, and the tests of those sign in with it.
