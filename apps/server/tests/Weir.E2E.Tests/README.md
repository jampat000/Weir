# Weir browser end-to-end tests

Playwright for .NET (Chromium) driving a **real** Weir server that serves the built web app, as the Docker and
Windows packages do. It is the browser counterpart of the contract suite and starts the server through that
suite's harness (`Weir.Contract.Tests`), so neither project loads a Weir assembly: the host is only built before
them and started as a process, with a fresh data folder, on a free port.

The tests are opt-in. Without `WEIR_E2E=1` every test is skipped, and they all carry `Category=E2E`.

## Running it

```bash
# 1. The web app, which the server serves (once, and after a web change)
cd apps/web && npm ci && npm run build

# 2. The server and these tests
cd ../server && dotnet build Weir.slnx

# 3. The Chromium that Microsoft.Playwright 1.63.0 drives (once per machine, and after a Playwright upgrade)
pwsh tests/Weir.E2E.Tests/bin/Debug/net10.0/playwright.ps1 install chromium

# 4. The suite
WEIR_E2E=1 dotnet test tests/Weir.E2E.Tests            # PowerShell: $env:WEIR_E2E = "1"
```

| What | How |
| --- | --- |
| Leave these tests out of a wider run | `--filter "Category!=E2E"` (they are skipped without `WEIR_E2E=1` anyway) |
| Browser install on Linux CI | `pwsh .../playwright.ps1 install --with-deps chromium` |
| Browser install without PowerShell | `dotnet tool install --global Microsoft.Playwright.CLI`, then `playwright install --with-deps chromium` |
| A published server instead of the built one | `WEIR_CONTRACT_SERVER=/path/to/Weir.dll` (or an executable) |
| Keep the server's data folder and log after the run | `WEIR_CONTRACT_KEEP_DATA=1` (log in `<folder>/contract-logs`) |
| A fixed session secret | `WEIR_SESSION_SECRET` (the harness default is used otherwise) |

A missing browser fails the first test with Playwright's own message naming the install command.

Screenshots of the high-risk pages are written to `artifacts/screenshots/` at the repository root (ignored by git,
overwritten each run). They are for looking at, not compared.

## How it works

- **`Harness/E2EServer`** is one server and one Playwright driver for the whole run (`ICollectionFixture`). It starts the
  built host with `WEIR_WEB_DIST=apps/web/dist` through `WeirServer.StartNewAsync`. The harness gives it high sign-in
  limits (every test signs up and signs in against the one server) and switches artwork lookups off; the settings
  that make the server quiet (workers, file watcher, periodic scan, work file sweeps) are put back to their
  defaults, because the Logs tests expect the job rows a running server writes. Without `WEIR_E2E=1` it starts nothing.
- **`Support/E2ETestBase`** resets per-test state before each test (users, sessions, suite settings and the library
  folders are cleared) and gives the test a headless Chromium of its own. All test
  classes share one collection, so tests run one at a time against the one server.
- **`Harness/E2EDatabase`** writes plain SQL to the running server's SQLite file for what the browser cannot create, an
  activity event the open Logs tab must pick up live.
- **`Support/ProcessingRig`** is a second Weir for a test that watches a file move through the screens: one worker over a fake
  ffmpeg, so a pass stays under way until the test releases it, and a fake Deluno. Files arrive and finish through the hand-off
  webhook and the outcome route, as a media manager makes them, never by writing to the database.
- **`Support/Navigation`** is sign-in, the side menu, the tabs of an area, Logs and the Activity chips. **`Support/PageChecks`**
  holds the structural checks and screenshots of the visual smoke tests.
