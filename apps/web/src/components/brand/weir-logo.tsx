/**
 * The Weir mark (#581): water turning over a weir crest into the tailrace, with the apron
 * below it. It replaces the hand-drawn "low wall with water over it" placeholder from #564.
 *
 * The geometry is generated, not hand-drawn. `design-options/logos-round4/build/trace.py`
 * thresholds the accepted source render to two colours and fits circles to every band edge;
 * `mark.py` regularises those measurements onto a 24-unit grid and emits these exact three paths
 * into `packaging/brand/weir-mark.svg`, which is in turn the source for the favicon, tray icon
 * and docs logo (`scripts/generate-brand-icons.py`). Drawn inline here rather than as an <img>
 * so it follows the theme tokens.
 *
 * This is the three-stream mark — the one traced directly off the Midjourney render the owner
 * accepted, and the one he asked for by name after #582 shipped a two-stream simplification
 * instead ("logo is not exact I want this one"). Three streams do not survive a 16px favicon:
 * the bands are sub-pixel at that size and fuse into a smear (see mark.py's SHIPPED_STREAMS
 * comment and design-options/logos-round4/gate-16px.png). But the sidebar mark here is never
 * rendered anywhere near that small, so it carries no such penalty, and the extra stream is what
 * makes it read as three-dimensional water rather than a flat arch. The 16px .ico frame is the
 * only place that trade-off still applies — see scripts/generate-brand-icons.py and
 * packaging/brand/README.md for the optical-size split.
 *
 * Three paths, all one colour. The mark used to be two tones — gold water over a stone wall —
 * but the Windows tray icon is a single-colour mask and cannot carry a second tone, so a
 * two-tone mark meant the tray never matched the app. If you change the geometry, change it in
 * mark.py and re-run `python design-options/logos-round4/build/build.py`, which rewrites the
 * brand SVGs and prints the path data to paste here. Do not edit the `d` attributes by hand.
