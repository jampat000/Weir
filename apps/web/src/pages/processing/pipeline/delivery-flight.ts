/**
 * The one movement on the Pipeline that is not a number changing: a file that has been delivered shows
 * it first (its card full and green for a moment), and then its poster flies from the card to the same
 * file on the Just finished shelf, where it lands in its place. The shelf's tile is kept out of sight
 * while the card still shows "Delivered", so the file is never in two places at once.
 *
 * Both the card's poster and the shelf's are 2:3, and the poster that flies is a copy of the card's, scaled
 * by one factor so it keeps its shape. It follows the shelf tile's place frame by frame, so it lands on the
 * tile even if the shelf slid or the page scrolled during the flight, and then gives way to the real tile
 * by fading rather than being swapped in a single frame (see flight-path for the path).
 *
 * With reduced motion, a page nobody is looking at, or a window being resized, nothing flies and the shelf
 * tile simply shows. The two components find each other in the document through the attributes below.
