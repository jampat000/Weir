# Posters and original languages

Weir shows a poster for the files it lists (Pipeline cards, the Just finished shelf, Activity, the Library page and a file's story). It gets them from Deluno's metadata service, which needs no key, and never from the browser: the web app only ever asks Weir for `/api/v1/artwork/posters/{id}`. The same lookup tells Weir the original language of each title, which a profile's *Keep the original language* rule uses. There is nothing to set up for either.

## Where a file's title comes from

- **A Deluno hand-off** may carry optional `title`, `year`, `tmdbId`, `tvdbId`, `imdbId`, `season`, `episode` and `posterUrl`. A malformed field is ignored, never an error. A `posterUrl` is used only when it is absolute https on `deluno-metadata-gateway.ejmdigital.workers.dev`, `image.tmdb.org`, `artworks.thetvdb.com` or `m.media-amazon.com` (`ArtworkPosterSource.ImageHosts`); anything else is ignored and the ids or the name decide.
- **Radarr and Sonarr imports** of a file Weir handed back carry the manager's own ids: Radarr's movie `tmdbId` and `imdbId`, Sonarr's series `tvdbId` and `imdbId`. They replace the title read from the name, so those files get an exact lookup. A message with no webhook secret could be from anybody, so it changes nothing; a missing or malformed id is ignored.
- **Every other file** is read from its path by `ArtworkTitleReader`: the release name, file name and folders for a film; the text before the season or episode marker for a series, so every episode shares one title.

## One lookup per title

`artwork_lookups` holds one row per title, keyed by TMDb id when known, otherwise by the normalised name and year (`ArtworkKeys`), with the `original_language` the service reported for it (null until it has answered, empty when it answered with none). `artwork_files` says which title each file has, and `artwork_posters` which images are stored; the images live in `WEIR_HOME/artwork/posters`, named by an opaque id derived from where the image came from.

`ArtworkResolverTask` (every 5 seconds) titles new files (`ArtworkDiscovery`) and settles up to 20 due lookups (`ArtworkResolver`), one at a time:

- A TMDb id is looked up exactly (`providerId=`); a series with only a TheTVDB id uses `/metadata/tvdb/tv/{id}`; anything else is a title search. A poster address from a hand-off skips the search.
- The service allows 120 calls a minute per address, shared with every other app on the network. Weir searches at most once every two seconds (`ArtworkRateLimiter`), pauses every lookup for as long as a 503 `Retry-After` asks (a minute when it names none, an hour at most) and for a minute after the service could not be reached.
- One search answers both questions: the first result with a poster names the image and the title's original language, so a title is never searched for twice, whichever of the two is needed first.
- A title the service does not know is remembered and asked about again after seven days. A title that could not be asked about is retried after 5 minutes, doubling up to 6 hours. Files from a library scan queue behind files Weir is processing.

## Original language

When a profile keeps the title's original language, `GatewayOriginalLanguageLookup` reads it from the title's row, found by the file's link (the TMDb id a manager gave, if it did) or else by the key its name gives; a series is keyed by its name, not its episode. A title nobody has asked about yet is asked about at once, through the same limiter and with the same memory of what the service did not know, so a pass never makes the service work harder than the background resolver does. When the service has no answer (it does not know the title, it is busy or unreachable, or it is switched off) the profile's language preferences choose the audio and the file's note says so.

## Pruning

About once an hour `ArtworkResolverTask` runs `ArtworkPruner`, which needs no network and runs even when the service is switched off. A file that is in neither `files` nor `library_files` is marked (`artwork_files.orphaned_at`); the mark clears if the file comes back. Thirty days after the mark (`ArtworkSchedule.GoneFileGrace`, so a re-download does not fetch its poster again) the row goes, then any title no file uses, then any poster no title uses, image and database row. What stays is one small row per title and per file Weir still knows.

## Settings and tests

- **There is no setting.** Posters and original languages are always on. The only way to turn them off is for an administrator to start Weir with `WEIR_ARTWORK_GATEWAY_URL=off`: nothing is looked up, every `poster_url` is null (stored images stay on disk) and a profile's language preferences choose the audio.
- `WEIR_ARTWORK_GATEWAY_URL` also points Weir at another gateway. The real service is a public address and must resolve to one; any other address is treated as a stand-in on this machine.
- **The metadata-provider routes are deprecated and kept for older clients.** `GET` and `PUT /api/v1/processing/metadata-provider` always answer `provider: "deluno-gateway"`, `base_url: null`, `key_configured: false` and `artwork_enabled: true`; a `PUT` is checked for shape and then ignored. `POST .../test` asks the service's `/health`. A TMDb key saved by an earlier version stays in the database, unread.
- **No test reaches the real service.** The server and contract test harnesses set the variable to `off`, and the tests that need a gateway use a fake (`FakeGateway` in `apps/server/tests/Weir.Contract.Tests/Harness/Fakes`, a scripted handler in the other .NET tests).
- TMDb requires its attribution text and logo wherever its data is used, and TheTVDB a link where its images show; System › About carries both.
