# The Weir content language

How the *content* of every Weir page is laid out. The shell around it — sidebar, top
bar, page header, workspace tab row — is finished and frozen; this document is only
about what sits inside a workspace panel.

The reference implementation is the Processing **Overview** tab
(`apps/web/src/pages/processing/processing-overview-tab.tsx`). The primitives it uses
are page-neutral and live in `apps/web/src/styles/weir-content.css`. Read this page,
then read that component, then convert your page.

---

## The three rules, in priority order

### 1. The page leads with what is happening now, as a band across the top

Not a grid of cards. One bordered band, full width, whose segments are as wide as the
number each carries, and each segment is a control that opens the detail behind it.

The band answers the first question a page exists to answer:

| Page              | The band is                                                             |
| ----------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Processing        | The pipeline: six file statuses, left to right, each a filter into Files |
| In hand           | Where the files in hand are sitting right now                            |
| Activity          | What has happened in the window being viewed, by outcome                 |
| Settings          | No band. Settings has no "now" — it starts at rule 3                     |

If you cannot name a "now" for your page, **do not invent one.** A page with no band
starts at rule 3 and that is a correct outcome, not a shortcut.

The band is the one place a page is allowed to be visually loud: a border, a filled
surface, a 3px accent rule along the top of each segment, a 30px number. Nothing else
on the page gets any of that.

### 2. One hero, then quiet

Where a page has a number that actually carries it, that number gets a wide tile and
its supporting numbers get narrow tiles beside it, in one row of unequal widths.

- The hero is the number someone would quote if asked how the thing is going. On
  Processing that is files processed in the last 30 days.
- Supporters qualify the hero. On Processing: success rate, and space reclaimed.
- Two or three supporters. Not four.

**Five identical boxes of equal weight is the thing this replaces.** If every tile on
your row is the same width, you have not applied this rule.

If the page has no single number worth that much room, skip the figure row entirely
and go to rule 3. An invented hero is worse than no hero.

### 3. Everything below the lead is borderless

No cards, no panels, no wells. Hierarchy comes from type scale and whitespace: a
section heading, a hairline, then content.

- A section is a heading on the left, its links on the right, a hairline under both,
  then the content.
- The only control the quiet body carries is a text link (`Open Libraries →`). Not a
  button with chrome.
- Tables lose their box. The header row is uppercase eyebrow type over a `--mm-line`
  hairline; body rows are separated by a fainter `--mm-border` hairline; the last row
  has none. (The mockup the owner approved keeps the per-row hairlines — that is the
  authority here, over any shorter description of this rule.)

This is where most of a page lives, and it should be the quietest part of it.

---

## Two standing rules that override the three above

### The chrome is frozen

Do not touch, in markup or in styles:

- `apps/web/src/components/shell/**` — sidebar, top bar
- `apps/web/src/components/shared/workspace-shell.tsx` — `WorkspacePage`,
  `WorkspacePanel`, `WorkspaceTabList`, and the page header and tab row they render
- Anything in `weir-shell.css` that styles the above

If a layout you want needs a change in there, **you do not do that layout.** Change
what is inside the panel instead. The owner: "I love the menus side and top."

### The empty state still takes over

A band of six zeroes on a fresh install looks broken. Whatever the page already does
when it has nothing must keep happening, ahead of the band and the figure row.

Processing has two distinct empties, and both are decided, not judged:

| Condition                                | What renders                                                                      |
| ---------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| No library has a watched folder          | The existing "Get started" checklist, alone. No band, no figures.                   |
| Folders set, but nothing in hand at all  | One `.mm-quiet-note` sentence where the band would be. The figure row still renders. |
| Census still loading, or failed to load  | The same `.mm-quiet-note` slot, with the loading or failure sentence.                |

Apply the same shape to your page: the strongest empty wins outright; a merely-zero
lead becomes a sentence, not a row of zeroes.

---

## The primitives

All of them are in `apps/web/src/styles/weir-content.css`. Use these; do not write
page-specific layout CSS unless the page genuinely needs something none of these do,
and if it does, add it here as another page-neutral primitive.

### Tokens

Two new custom properties, both layout-only, both defined in `weir-tokens.css`. No
colour and no font was added, and none may be.

| Token             | Default | Set where                     | For                                                     |
| ----------------- | ------- | ----------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| `--mm-flow-share` | `1`     | Inline, per band segment      | That segment's share of the band's width (unitless)      |
| `--mm-meter-fill` | `0%`    | Inline, per `.mm-figure__meter` | How full the bar is                                    |

Everything else is an existing `--mm-*` token. `apps/web/scripts/check-design-tokens.mjs`
fails the build on any `var(--mm-…)` that `weir-tokens.css` does not define, so a new
token means a line in that file and a reason beside it.

### Rule 1 — the lead

| Class                            | Element                  | For                                                         |
| -------------------------------- | ------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| `.mm-lead`                       | `div`                    | Wraps the whole lead: interrupts, band, caption, figure row   |
| `.mm-lead-band`                  | `div`                    | The band. Wraps to more rows on narrow panels, by itself      |
| `.mm-lead-band__segment`         | `button`                 | One segment. Set `--mm-flow-share` inline                     |
| `.mm-lead-band__segment--empty`  | modifier                 | Count is zero: grey rule, dimmed value                        |
| `.mm-lead-band__segment--live`   | modifier                 | Something is happening here now: accent rule and value        |
| `.mm-lead-band__label`           | `span`                   | The stage name, uppercase eyebrow                             |
| `.mm-lead-band__value`           | `span`                   | The count                                                     |
| `.mm-lead-band__hint`            | `span`                   | One short line saying what the stage means                    |
| `.mm-lead-band__go`              | `span`, `aria-hidden`    | "Filter →", revealed on hover and keyboard focus              |
| `.mm-lead-band__pulse`           | `i`, `aria-hidden`       | The live dot. Honours `prefers-reduced-motion`                |
| `.mm-lead-caption`               | `p`                      | One line under the band: meaning on the left, the takeaway sentence on the right |

The segment must be a real `<button>` (or `<a>`), never a `div` with `onClick`: the
focus ring, the `→` reveal and keyboard use all hang off that.

**Weighting.** Share is the raw count, floored at 6% of the band's total so an empty
stage still reads as a stage:
`share = total === 0 ? 1 : Math.max(count, total * 0.06)`. Reuse that formula.

**Honesty.** If the band draws a fixed set of states and the data has others, count
them and say so in the caption ("5 more in states the band does not show"). Do not
silently drop them, and do not point two segments at the same filter.

### Rule 2 — the figure row

| Class                     | Element  | For                                                                |
| ------------------------- | -------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `.mm-figure-row`          | `div`    | The grid. **First child is the hero at 1.8fr; every later child is 1fr.** No modifier needed for the widths |
| `.mm-figure`              | `section`| One tile                                                           |
| `.mm-figure--hero`        | modifier | Puts the big type on the hero's value. Only on the first child      |
| `.mm-figure--warn`        | modifier | The value is a bad number; paints it `--mm-status-failed-text`      |
| `.mm-figure__eyebrow`     | `div`    | Label on the left, optional context on the right                    |
| `.mm-figure__value`       | `div`    | The number                                                          |
| `.mm-figure__unit`        | `span`   | The words on the hero number's baseline ("files handed back")        |
| `.mm-figure__note`        | `p`      | One sentence under the value                                        |
| `.mm-figure__meter`       | `div`, `aria-hidden` | Percentage bar. Set `--mm-meter-fill` inline           |
| `.mm-figure__foot`        | `div`    | Two or three smaller figures along the bottom of the hero tile       |
| `.mm-figure__foot-value`  | `span`   | One of those numbers                                                |
| `.mm-figure__foot-label`  | `span`   | Its uppercase label                                                 |

At ≤1280px the hero spans the full width with the supporters in two columns beneath;
at ≤720px everything stacks. That happens by itself — do not add breakpoints.

### Rule 3 — the quiet body

| Class                        | Element   | For                                                       |
| ---------------------------- | --------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| `.mm-quiet-stack`            | `div`     | The page body. Vertical rhythm between the lead and each section |
| `.mm-quiet-section`          | `section` | One borderless section                                    |
| `.mm-quiet-section__head`    | `div`     | Heading row with the hairline under it                    |
| `.mm-quiet-section__title`   | `h2`      | The heading. Give it an id and `aria-labelledby` the section |
| `.mm-quiet-section__aside`   | `div`     | The section's links, baseline-aligned with the heading    |
| `.mm-quiet-section__body`    | `div`     | The content under the hairline                            |
| `.mm-quiet-link`             | `button` / `a` | The only control shape in the quiet body. Write the label with a trailing `→` |
| `.mm-quiet-note`             | `p`       | A muted paragraph: empty states, captions, explanations   |
| `.mm-quiet-table-wrap`       | `div`     | Horizontal scroll container                               |
| `.mm-quiet-table`            | `table`   | The borderless table                                      |
| `.mm-quiet-table__name`      | `th[scope=row]` | The row's name cell                                 |
| `.mm-quiet-table__strong`    | `span`    | A primary value inside a cell                             |
| `.mm-quiet-table__sub`       | `span`    | The explanatory line under it                             |
| `.mm-quiet-badge` / `--off`  | `span`    | A small pill beside a name                                |
| `.mm-quiet-state` / `--ok` / `--missing` | `span` | Set / not-set, as a word with a tick or a warning colour |
| `.mm-interrupt`              | `ul`      | Things that are broken or blocking, **above** the band    |
| `.mm-interrupt__item`        | `li`      | One of them                                               |
| `.mm-interrupt__text`        | `span`    | The sentence. The `!` marker is drawn by CSS              |

Every `td` in a `.mm-quiet-table` needs `data-label="…"` matching its column heading:
below 760px the table becomes stacked rows and that attribute is the label.

**The interrupt.** Something broken may sit above the band, because it outranks the
routine. It is still a list of sentences with a link each — not a card, not a banner,
not a coloured box. The loud thing on a page is the band, and there is only one.

---

## Worked example: Processing Overview, before and after

**Before.** Three stacked `.mm-card .mm-dash-card .mm-module-surface` panels inside a
`.mm-bubble-stack`:

1. "Needs attention" (or "Get started") — a card containing a list of amber-filled rows.
2. "At a glance" — a card containing `.mm-proc-stats`, a `repeat(auto-fit, minmax(6.5rem, 1fr))`
   grid of five bordered `.mm-proc-stat` boxes: Processed, Failed, Success rate,
   Waiting, Running. All the same size, all the same weight, nothing leading.
3. "Libraries" — a card containing `.mm-proc-table` and a row of four secondary buttons.

**After.** A `.mm-quiet-stack` holding a `.mm-lead` and one `.mm-quiet-section`:

1. `.mm-interrupt` — the same attention sentences, borderless, above the band.
2. `.mm-lead-band` — six segments from the file census
   (`GET /api/v1/processing/files` → `status_counts`), in pipeline order: Waiting,
   On hold, Processing, Done, Skipped, Failed. Clicking one calls
   `onOpenTab("files", status)`, which the page turns into `?tab=files&status=…`; the
   Files tab already reads that parameter on mount, so the filter is real, not cosmetic.
3. `.mm-lead-caption` — what the band means, plus the two operator facts that used to
   be buried in the stats card (the settle time, and how many run at once), plus the
   one-sentence takeaway and the count of files in states the band does not draw.
4. `.mm-figure-row` — hero **Processed** (last 30 days) with *Rewritten* and *Already
   right* along its foot; supporters **Success rate** (with a meter) and **Reclaimed**.
5. `.mm-quiet-section` "Libraries" — the same table, now `.mm-quiet-table`, with the
   four buttons demoted to `.mm-quiet-link`s beside the heading.

The data the old page showed is all still there. "Waiting" and "Running" moved from
job counts to the file census, which is the same question asked of the better source.

Behaviour that did **not** change: the load-error branch, the loading branch, the
attention copy, the setup checklist, the rule-set summary strings, the media-type badge
suppression, the scan-interval wording.

## What NOT to do

1. **Do not touch the shell.** See above. This includes "just one padding tweak".
2. **Do not add a colour, a font, a shadow or a radius.** Only tokens already in
   `weir-tokens.css`. A new `--mm-*` token that is not pure layout is a rejection.
3. **Do not put a card anywhere below the lead.** No `.mm-card`, no `.mm-dash-card`,
   no `.mm-module-surface`, no `border` on a section. The figure tiles are the only
   bordered things outside the band, and they belong to rule 2.
4. **Do not build an equal-width tile row.** If you find yourself writing
   `repeat(auto-fit, minmax(…, 1fr))` for numbers, you are rebuilding the thing that
   was rejected.
5. **Do not invent a lead.** No band without a real "now"; no hero without a real
   number; no sparkline, trend arrow or percentage the API does not return.
6. **Do not draw a band of zeroes.** Route every empty through the table above.
7. **Do not make a segment or a row a clickable `div`.** Buttons and links only.
8. **Do not copy the mockup's class names.** `o1-*`, `o2-*`, `o3-*`, `o4-*`, `mk-*`
   are a throwaway static reproduction. The classes in this document are the real ones.
9. **Do not delete a test because it fails on the new markup.** Read it. If it is
   asserting layout, update the assertion. If it is asserting behaviour — a filter
   works, an empty state wins, a secret never reaches the DOM — keep it and make it
   pass.
10. **Do not leave superseded CSS behind.** When the last user of an `mm-proc-*`-style
    rule goes, delete the rule in the same PR.
11. **Do not widen a `data-testid`'s meaning.** Keep the ids the E2E suite uses
    (`tests/e2e/weir/test_app_navigation_audit.py` and friends) pointing at the same
    thing they pointed at before.

## Gates

Run all of these in `apps/web` before opening a PR: `npm ci`, `npm run lint`,
`npm run format`, `npm test`, `npm run build` (which runs `check:tokens` and the
bundle budget). From the repo root: `node scripts/check-dead-code.mjs` and
`node scripts/check-agent-docs.mjs`.

Then look at the page. Dark and light, 1440 and 1024 wide, with data and on a fresh
empty install. Unit tests have let a blank page ship in this repo before.
