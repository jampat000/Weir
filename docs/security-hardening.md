# Security Hardening

This checklist defines the current practical hardening baseline for Weir.

## Authentication and setup

- First-run bootstrap is only available when no admin user exists.
- Bootstrap from a non-loopback peer needs the one-time setup code Weir logs and writes to
  `WEIR_HOME/setup-code` at start-up; a loopback peer (the tray's `127.0.0.1`) does not.
- Passwords shorter than 8 characters must be blocked by both frontend and backend validation.
- Login and bootstrap routes are rate-limited per IP; login also backs off per account after 5
  failures in 15 minutes, independent of which addresses the guesses came from.
- Authenticated state-changing browser requests require CSRF protection.
- Session cookies are HTTP-only.
- Secure cookies should be enabled when deployed behind HTTPS.
- Existing users must persist across restarts and upgrades.
- Requests are only answered for a `Host` Weir recognises (see
  [Reverse Proxy: Host header allow-list](https://github.com/jampat000/Weir/blob/main/docs-site/docs/deployment/reverse-proxy.md)) — set `WEIR_ALLOWED_HOSTS` for a reverse-proxy domain.
- Install-level routes (configuration bundle, backups, updates, the directory browser, media
  manager and notification channel credentials, history reset) require the admin role.

## Secrets and private data

- The data folder that holds the database, backups, logs and secrets is protected against other local
  accounts: on Windows the tray locks it to its owner on every start; in Docker the entrypoint writes secrets
  with `umask 077` and runs the server as a non-root user; a bare source install should restrict `WEIR_HOME`
  itself (for example `chmod 700`).
- Real `.env` files must never be committed.
- Runtime SQLite databases must never be committed.
- Logs, backups, media paths, API keys, provider tokens, and session secrets must never be committed.
- Public issue logs must redact secrets, private hostnames, and private filesystem paths.
- Docker can generate a persistent session secret when one is not provided.
- `WEIR_SESSION_SECRET` signs sessions and CSRF tokens; `WEIR_CREDENTIALS_SECRET` encrypts saved provider
  credentials. Keep them separate.
- `WEIR_METRICS_BEARER_TOKEN` can gate machine access to `/metrics` without requiring an operator browser session.
- To rotate `WEIR_CREDENTIALS_SECRET`, set the new value as `WEIR_CREDENTIALS_SECRET`, add the old value to
  `WEIR_PREVIOUS_CREDENTIALS_SECRETS`, restart Weir, then re-save every media manager
  connection (Setup › Connections › Media managers). After every saved credential has been re-written with the new value, remove the old value from
  `WEIR_PREVIOUS_CREDENTIALS_SECRETS` and restart again.

## Repository and dependency controls

- `main` is protected by GitHub rules.
- The required check is `ci-passed` (the `CI` workflow's verdict job; see `docs/local-development.md`).
- Dependabot is security-only: every ecosystem sets `open-pull-requests-limit: 0`, so no routine version pull requests open, while Dependabot security updates still do. It covers NuGet (`apps/server`, `apps/tray`), npm (`apps/web`, `docs-site`), GitHub Actions.
- CodeQL code scanning (C# and JavaScript/TypeScript) runs on `main`, pull requests to `main`, weekly schedule, and manual dispatch.
- Security vulnerabilities are reported privately through `SECURITY.md`.
- Public issues are not used for unpatched vulnerabilities.
- CI runs a NuGet vulnerability scan (`node scripts/check-dotnet-vulnerabilities.mjs apps/server/Weir.slnx`, failing on High or Critical) and `npm audit` in addition to CodeQL and standard test gates.
- An npm advisory with no fixed release can be let through only by an entry in `apps/web/dependency-audit-exceptions.json` or `docs-site/dependency-audit-exceptions.json`: the advisory id, why it cannot reach users (`mitigation`) and an `expires` date at most 30 days out, approved by the owner. An expired entry fails the scan again. Remove the entry as soon as a fixed release can be taken.

## Windows Firewall

- The Windows package's server listens on this PC only (`127.0.0.1` and `[::1]`) until LAN access is allowed, so
  nothing on the network can connect to a fresh or silently installed Weir, whatever the firewall says. LAN access
  is one saved choice (`lan-access` in the data folder). It turns on when the person says yes at the install
  prompt and the rule is created, when the tray's "Allow other devices on your network..." item succeeds, when
  an admin chooses "Devices on my network" on System › About, or when `--allow-lan` runs. The tray's "Only allow
  this PC" item, or "This PC only" on System › About, turns it off again. Any change restarts the server with
  the new bind address. A saved choice that cannot be read or understood counts as off. Docker and a bare source
  install are unchanged: the server binds every interface there, and the operator publishes the port.
- An install that predates the setting keeps its reach: the first start with no saved choice turns LAN access on
  only if Windows already allows Weir's server in (Weir's own rule, or any enabled inbound allow rule for
  `WeirServer.exe` that no enabled block rule cancels), and off otherwise, then saves the answer.
- The Windows package can create exactly one inbound firewall rule, named `Weir`, scoped to the installed
  server's program path (`server\WeirServer.exe` under Velopack's stable `current` folder) — never a port-wide
  rule, and the program path is fixed by the installer, never taken from user input.
- The rule covers every network profile: Domain, Private and Public, at install, from the tray's
  "Allow other devices on your network..." menu item, and from `--allow-lan`. Windows often marks a home network
  Public, and a rule that skipped Public would make "Devices on my network" do nothing there. Weir is still behind
  its own sign-in, and first-run setup from another device needs the one-time setup code. A rule written by an
  earlier version, for Private and Domain only, is replaced by the current one whenever the tray configures the
  rule; and when the PC is on a network that rule does not cover, choosing the network again (or **Try again** on
  System › About) asks Windows for the administrator approval again, which widens it. An install that turned
  network access on under 1.0.0-rc.1 still has such a rule, and on a Private network nothing would ask: so the
  first interactive tray start after the update, with network access on and a rule that leaves a profile out,
  asks Windows once to widen it. The question is recorded (`firewall-rule-widening-asked` in the data folder)
  before the prompt shows, and never repeats whatever the answer; a `--silent` start or a PC with no desktop
  never asks.
- Creating or removing it needs a Windows admin (UAC) elevation; Weir asks for that once, at first run, with a
  plain explanation, and never asks again automatically if declined. Turning LAN access off leaves the rule in
  place: with nothing listening for the network it lets nothing in.
- System › About changes the same saved choice: `PUT /api/v1/suite/network-access` is admin only, carries the
  session's CSRF token like every other settings write, and only writes the `lan-access` file in the data folder
  (the same `on` / `off` text the tray writes). The server never touches the firewall itself. The tray, which
  watches the file, restarts the server for it and, when the choice is for the network and the `Weir` rule is
  missing, raises the same Windows admin prompt as its own menu, on the PC itself, so a person who is signed in to
  Weir from another device cannot approve it for themselves. Declining the prompt still restarts the server for
  the network, because that is the saved choice; Windows Firewall then blocks, System › About says so, and
  choosing the network again asks again. A choice saved while the tray is not running waits for it. Docker and a
  bare install answer the `PUT` with 409 and say what decides there (the port mapping, the `--host` option).
  Every change is written to Activity as "Network access changed", with the admin who made it.
- `--allow-lan` (for a program driving Weir unattended) never elevates itself and never prompts. It always turns
  LAN access on, because that is what the caller asked for; it creates the rule only when already elevated, and
  otherwise logs that the rule was not created and still exits zero. The bind address, not the rule, is what
  keeps a Weir local-only, so an unelevated `--allow-lan` leaves the decision to Windows Firewall.
- The bootstrap setup code and the `Host` allow-list do not depend on any of this: they apply to whichever
  addresses the server listens on. While Weir is local-only, first-run setup from another device is not
  possible, because that device cannot connect at all.
- Reading the current state (for System › About) needs no admin rights and touches nothing; only the Windows
  package does this — Docker and a bare install report `not_applicable` with the reason. It reports "only this
  PC" from the server's own bind address, shows a saved choice the server has not caught up with as pending, and
  consults the firewall only when the server listens, or is about to listen, for the network. The addresses it
  lists are this PC's IPv4 addresses on adapters that have a gateway, never self-assigned ones.
- Weir never modifies a firewall rule it did not create: removing block rules is limited to inbound rules whose
  program path matches Weir's own server exe exactly.

## Release controls

- Releases are built from tagged source.
- Windows and Docker artifacts are produced by GitHub Actions.
- Local Docker Desktop is not required to validate Docker packaging.
- Release artifacts remain under AGPL-3.0-or-later.

## Ongoing checks

Run this list before any major release:

1. Confirm no secrets or runtime files are staged.
2. Confirm dependency audit jobs pass.
3. Confirm CodeQL has no open high-confidence security findings.
4. Confirm auth setup, login, logout, and password validation smoke tests pass.
5. Confirm backup files do not expose secrets in public docs, logs, or screenshots.
6. Confirm Activity and System › Logs do not expose tokens or internal implementation details to normal users.
