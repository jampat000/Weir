"""Trace James's chosen weir mark (source.png) and report its measured geometry (#581).

Why this exists at all
----------------------
Rounds one to three were hand-drawn marks and all four were rejected. The accepted mark is a
Midjourney render, and the first attempt at productionising it was to look at the picture and
redraw the geometry by eye. That produced a symmetric dome: the eye reads "arch", draws an arch,
and the water is gone. So this round does not eyeball anything. It thresholds the PNG to two
colours, walks the actual contours, and least-squares fits circles to each band edge. Every
number in `mark.py` comes out of this script, and the fit residuals are printed so a reviewer can
see that the circles are real features of the artwork and not a story told about it.

No potrace on the build machines and no scipy in tests/requirements.txt, so the tracing is
PIL + numpy only: threshold, flood-fill labelling, run-length scanning per row and column to
recover each band edge, then a Kasa algebraic circle fit per edge.

Run it from anywhere:

    python packaging/brand/build/trace.py

It prints a table and writes trace-overlay.png next to source.png so the fitted circles can be
checked against the pixels they were fitted to.
