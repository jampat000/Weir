# Vendored FFmpeg and MKVToolNix for build-velopack.ps1: dot-sourced from there
# (". $PSScriptRoot\build-velopack-vendored-media-tools.ps1"), split out (#747) so build-velopack.ps1
# stays under the project's line-count guideline. Dot-sourcing runs this in the caller's own scope, so
# $PSScriptRoot here is still packaging/windows (the dot-sourcing script's own folder), and the
# variables and functions below are usable from build-velopack.ps1 exactly as if this were inline.
#
# Both tools follow the same download / verify / cache shape: a pinned version and checksum, a stamp
# file recording what is currently vendored, and a re-hash of the extracted exe(s) on every run
# (including a cache hit) so a stale or tampered vendor folder is caught without trusting the stamp's
# own say-so about what it contains.

# Every download below goes through Save-PinnedDownload: the upstream URL first, then Weir's own
# releases, which carry a copy of each archive, against the same pinned SHA-256.
. "$PSScriptRoot\pinned-download.ps1"

# Ignored by version control and reused between builds: Ensure-WindowsFfmpegRuntime downloads again
# only when the vendored copy doesn't match the pin below (CI caches this folder too).
#
# Pinned the same way #548 pins MKVToolNix below: a specific, immutable BtbN release rather than
# the `latest` tag. BtbN republishes `latest` from git master continuously, so it is a moving
# target with no stable checksum authority of its own — its checksums.sha256 is published inside
# that same mutable release, which proves a download wasn't corrupted in transit, not who built it
# or that it is the build Weir was tested against.
#
# The shared build (ffmpeg.exe/ffprobe.exe linked against av*.dll instead of each embedding its
# own copy of every library) rather than BtbN's static build, because Weir vendors both exes: the
# static zip is ~163 MB compressed with each exe carrying its own ~130 MB of statically-linked
# libraries, while the shared zip is ~73 MB compressed with the exes under 1 MB combined and the six
# av*.dll files (avcodec/avdevice/avfilter/avformat/avutil/swresample/swscale) shared between them.
# Windows always searches an exe's own directory for a DLL first regardless of PATH (the "safe DLL
# search order"), so ffmpeg.exe and ffprobe.exe find their av*.dll siblings without any code change —
# MediaToolLocations/MediaToolResolver only ever check that ffmpeg.exe and ffprobe.exe exist in the
# candidate directory (apps/server/src/Weir.Infrastructure/Media/MediaToolResolver.cs), never their
# internal linkage. ffplay.exe ships in the same zip but is never copied out: Weir has no use for it.
#
# BtbN deletes its dated releases after about two weeks, so a pin is downloadable from BtbN for only that
# long. Every Weir release carries a copy of the archives it was built with (fetch-bundled-tool-sources.ps1),
# and a build whose pinned file is gone from BtbN takes that copy instead (pinned-download.ps1). A bump
# still takes the newest dated release, the one certain to be on BtbN, because the first release built
# from a new pin has no copy of its archives on Weir's releases yet.
#
# To bump: browse https://github.com/BtbN/FFmpeg-Builds/releases, pick a dated
# autobuild-YYYY-MM-DD-HH-MM tag (or a versioned "release" build such as n9.0.2 if BtbN has cut
# one), and find the win64 LGPL **shared** zip in its assets — e.g. with
# `gh release view <tag> -R BtbN/FFmpeg-Builds --json assets`. Update $ffmpegVersion,
# $ffmpegReleaseTag and $ffmpegArchiveName together, then get $ffmpegArchiveSha256 by downloading
# that zip to a scratch folder (never the repo) and hashing it yourself — don't just copy the
# number from the release's own checksums.sha256, since that is the thing being pinned against.
# Extract the zip and hash ffmpeg.exe, ffprobe.exe and every av*.dll under bin\ for
# $ffmpegExeSha256/$ffprobeExeSha256/$ffmpegSharedLibrarySha256 (a name -> hash map, one entry per
# library — the versioned filenames such as avcodec-63.dll change across ffmpeg releases). Finally
# delete packaging/windows/vendor/ffmpeg and re-run this script once to pick up and verify the
# new build end to end.
