# does not keep files forever (BtbN prunes its dated autobuild releases after a couple of weeks), so when

# copy of every archive they were built with (release.yml). The same pin applies to both sources: bytes
# that do not match it are refused, wherever they came from. Weir's releases are found from the public
# release feed and their download addresses, which do not count against GitHub's API allowance (60 an hour
# without a token, shared by the whole network); the API's release list is asked only when those find
# nothing. scripts/pinned-download.mjs does the same for the Node scripts.
