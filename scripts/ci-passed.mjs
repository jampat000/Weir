// CI's single verdict (the `ci-passed` job in .github/workflows/ci.yml): every job that was due for this change
// ran and passed, and every job that was not due was skipped by path filtering, not by an error.
//
// `changes` decides which jobs are due and publishes one run_* flag per job; GATES below maps each job to its
// flag (null: the job always runs). A due job must end `success`. A job that was not due must end `skipped`:
// anything else means the flags and the job conditions disagree, which is a bug in ci.yml to fix, not a pass.
// `changes` itself must succeed, because without it no flag can be trusted.
//
// Usage (in ci.yml): NEEDS='${{ toJSON(needs) }}' node scripts/ci-passed.mjs
