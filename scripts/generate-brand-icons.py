"""Regenerate every raster Weir icon from the SVG sources in packaging/brand.

The SVGs are the source of truth. This renders them with Playwright's Chromium (already a test
dependency: tests/requirements.txt) and writes PNG-framed .ico files, the format Windows has read
since Vista.

    python scripts/generate-brand-icons.py

Outputs (all committed):
  apps/web/public/favicon.svg, favicon.ico, apple-touch-icon.png
  packaging/windows/assets/weir-tray-icon.ico      (tray and installer icon)
  docs-site/static/img/favicon.ico, logo.svg, logo-dark.svg

## Two optical sizes in one .ico (#582)

The three-stream primary mark is the product's icon at every size a person reads it at, so
`weir-app-icon.svg` is the source for every frame 24px and above, same as every other asset here.
But a multi-resolution .ico is the one place two different drawings of "the same icon" have to
live side by side in a single file, and at 16px three streams cannot survive: a 1.85-unit band on
a 24-unit grid is 1.23 device pixels there, sub-pixel by construction, so the arcs fuse into a
smear. The 16px frame therefore renders from `weir-app-icon-small.svg` — the same tile with the
two-stream fallback geometry. At 24 and 32 the three streams stay distinct in all three
renderings (`design-options/logos-round4/gate-16px.png`), so the cutoff is 16px only.
`favicon.svg` itself (the SVG favicon, not the .ico) is unaffected: browsers scale one vector for
it, at whatever size they show it, so it is always the three-stream primary mark like every other
SVG in this repo.
