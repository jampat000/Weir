"""Correct-behaviour proof for #543 items 1-3, fixed in the .NET server only (ADR-0017: Python is retiring).

Each test asserts what ``/api/v1/activity/recent`` should do; Python still has the underlying bug
(the README section of ``apps/server`` documents the fix), so these are marked ``known_bug`` for
``backends=("python",)`` — dotnet must pass them now, and the marker comes off once (if ever)
Python is fixed too.

Two things every test here works around:

- ``seed.stopped`` restarts the server on a new port, so every client is created *after* the
  seeding block, the way ``tests/contract/refiner/_helpers.py``'s ``ensure_viewer`` does — a client
  built beforehand would still be pointed at the old, now-dead port.
- The server's own activity-retention sweep prunes events older than 90 days (the default), and
  runs against real wall-clock time even in a test server, so seeded rows are dated close to
  ``datetime.now(UTC)`` rather than a fixed past date that the sweep could delete out from under
  the test.
