"""Correct behaviour for #533: the switch to turn off periodic watched-folder scans must do so.

On Python, ``WEIR_PROCESSING_WATCHED_FOLDER_REMUX_SCAN_DISPATCH_SCHEDULE_ENABLED`` is documented and
present in settings, but nothing in ``WeirSettings`` even parses it (see ``core/config.py``) and
``processing_library_periodic_scan_enabled`` (``processing_watched_folder_remux_scan_dispatch_periodic_enqueue.py``)
only checks the library's own ``enabled`` flag. Its sibling,
``WEIR_PROCESSING_WATCHED_FOLDER_REMUX_SCAN_DISPATCH_PERIODIC_ENQUEUE_REMUX_JOBS``, only stops *remux*
jobs from being queued off a scan's findings — the scan itself still runs and still enqueues its own
``processing.watched_folder.remux_scan_dispatch.v1`` job. See the comment on this in
``tests/contract/support/launcher.py``, which the whole suite works around by leaving the periodic
timer alone and only counting the jobs a test itself caused.

Fixed in the .NET port (ProcessingWatchedFolderScanDispatchScheduleTask, apps/server/src/Weir.Infrastructure/
Jobs): the environment variable is parsed into WeirOptions and read every tick as a global kill switch,
alongside a second, independent per-scope check (the operator settings screen's Movies/TV periodic-scan
switch, itself equally dead in Python). Not fixed in Python — the backend is being retired (ADR-0017).

No ``known_bug`` marker here: within the short window these tests can afford, Python does not queue a
periodic scan for this library either way (switch on or off) — its periodic loop appears not to have
taken its first tick yet this soon after a restart, which this black-box timing test cannot tell apart
from "correctly disabled". The dead code is still real (grep core/config.py and
processing_watched_folder_remux_scan_dispatch_periodic_enqueue.py: the switch is parsed nowhere and
processing_scope_periodic_scan_enabled is never called), but this particular test cannot demonstrate it
within a contract-suite time budget, so it is not marked as a reproduced known bug. The .NET fix is
proven two ways: directly here (both tests pass against dotnet), and deterministically with a controlled
clock in Weir.Infrastructure.Tests.Jobs.ProcessingWatchedFolderScanDispatchScheduleTaskTests, which ticks the
scheduler many times over simulated minutes without waiting in real time.
